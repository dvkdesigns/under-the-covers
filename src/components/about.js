          Under the Covers: The Band Bringing the Fun to Fort Lauderdale and
          Beyond
        </h2>
        <p className="about-us__description">
          If you're looking for a band that will crank up the energy, belt out
          the hits, and have your crowd singing along before the first chorus is
          over, look no further than Under the Covers. Hailing from Fort
          Lauderdale, this four-piece powerhouse delivers everything from '80s
          rock anthems to 2010s sing-along pop hits—all with a wall of sound and
          a side of tongue-in-cheek humor.
        </p>
        <p className="about-us__description">
          The band's story starts like all great rock tales: a Facebook ad, a
          few jam sessions, and a unanimous decision that their new guitarist
          was “the guy we need.” After a five-month boot camp in rehearsal
          rooms, Under the Covers burst onto the scene with a raucous Halloween
          weekend debut, proving they could turn even the undead into dancing
          machines.

        <p className="about-us__description">
          And the name? Sure, it's a nod to their status as a cover band, but
          it's also a cheeky wink to the fact that these guys know how to have
          fun—onstage and off. They're not just covering songs; they're covering
          your night in good vibes, great music, and plenty of laughs.
        </p>

          <b>The Music</b>
          <br /> Under the Covers is like your favorite playlist come to life.
          They cover it all: classic rock, alternative jams, pop hits, and even
          a sprinkle of metal for good measure. Think Queen meets Foo Fighters,
          with a dash of Benson Boon to keep things spicy. But their secret
          weapon? Sing-alongs. Whether it's a crowd favorite from Journey or a
          guilty pleasure from the Backstreet Boys, they know how to get
          everyone involved—microphone optional.

          <b>The Members</b>
          <br /> At the heart of the band is Tyson, the drummer-slash-frontman
          who can keep a beat while keeping the audience in stitches.
          Quick-witted and interactive, he's the ringleader of this circus of
          sound. Surrounding him is Tony, who rocks rhythm guitar and shares
          lead vocal duties, Al, the bassist who brings the boom, and Dan, the
          lead guitarist with riffs sharp enough to cut glass. Together, they
          create a musical force that's as tight as their jeans used to be in
          the '90s.
        </p>
        <p className="about-us__description">
          <b>The Shows</b>
          <br /> From bars and breweries to festivals and private events, Under
          the Covers adapts to any venue. Acoustic set? No problem. Full-blown
          electric party? They've got you covered—literally. Their mission is
          simple: get people singing, dancing, drinking, and laughing.
        </p>
        <p className="about-us__description">
          <b>What sets them apart?</b>
          <br /> It's their ability to turn any gig into an unforgettable
          experience. Tyson's banter keeps the crowd engaged, while the band's
          seamless transitions from rock to pop to metal keep the energy
          flowing. Spilled drink on the stage? They'll roll with it. Power
          outage? They'll grab an acoustic guitar and turn it into a campfire
          sing-along.
        </p>
        <p className="about-us__description">

          bar.
